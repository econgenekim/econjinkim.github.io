- [Estimating Switching Costs for Telecommunication Services and Bundles*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00036846.2022.2030046) (with [Hyunchul Kim](https://hyunkimecon.github.io/)), Accepted at Applied Economics, [working paper version](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3787321)

> <details><summary>Abstract</summary>  We develop a consumer-level demand model of telecommunications and broadcasting services taking into account the exhaustive set of alternatives available to consumers, including bundled services. We then estimate the switching costs associated with bundling. Previous studies are confined to choices of only one or two services, rather than addressing inter-relationships among different services made possible through bundling. We find that our approach improves the accuracy of switching cost estimates compared with when the choice sets are restricted in demand models. Our results also indicate that switching costs incurred with bundling is substantial, making up approximately 65% of monthly service costs. </details>

-  Double/Debiased Machine Learning for Static Games with Incomplete Information (new drafts will be updated soon), Conference Presented at NASMES 2023, IAAE 2023, EARIE 2023

> <details><summary>Abstract</summary>  This paper develops estimation and inference methods for structural game models with high-dimensional data. By integrating double/debiased machine learning (DML) into static games with incomplete information, the developed estimator enables the use of machine learning
estimators. For an empirical application, I study the issue of rural pharmacy access. The decline in independent pharmacies, associated with the entry of chain pharmacies, has led to more limited pharmacy access in rural towns. In this context, I apply the developed estimator to examine the entry and exit of independent pharmacies with strategic interactions. I find that the effect of a rival independent pharmacy is 50% larger using the developed methodologies than
using the traditional method. This difference is primarily due to machine learningâ€™s ability to accommodate flexible functional forms and its higher predictive performance. Counterfactual exercises are used to discuss policy interventions aimed at improving limited pharmacy access in rural towns. </details>
