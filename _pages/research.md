-  ["Rural Pharmacy Access and Competition: Static Games with Machine Learning" (Job Market Paper)](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/87rbv5kq5t2sxymz6acva/JMP_HJ_Kim.pdf?rlkey=fhs1hggnb6vmu2u9ncymn67u6&dl=0), [Online Appendix](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mla3xap1u7fb1yj8xodmq/Online_Appendix_HJ_Kim.pdf?rlkey=8vi95zb8zxaplvx2tm89hy2xs&dl=0)

> <details><summary>Abstract</summary> This paper provides the first empirical evidence for the impact of the entry of chain pharmacies on competition,  market structure, and pharmacy access in rural towns. Using a detailed panel dataset spanning 2000-2019 in the Midwestern United States, I document that the entries of new chain pharmacies in urban towns have led to a large decline in the number of independent pharmacies from nearby rural towns. These industry shifts contribute to a decrease in pharmacy access in rural towns, especially in towns where over 20 percent of the population is aged 65 or older. To decompose the competition effects from chain pharmacies and rival independent pharmacies, I utilize existing static game models. To allow for a data-driven selection of many market characteristics in pharmacy profits, I incorporate double/debiased machine learning (DML) into the estimation of static games and provide valid inferences.  By leveraging the predictive performance of machine learning estimators, I find that the impact of a rival independent pharmacy on profit is 50 percent greater than that implied by existing models. In rural towns with a high elderly population ratio, the estimated model shows that chain pharmacy entries could explain 40 percent of the closures of independent pharmacies between 2000 and 2019. A subsidy policy counterfactual simulation shows that 16 percent of rural towns previously identified as having limited pharmacy access would no longer be categorized as such.

- "Welfare Effects of Chain Pharmacy Expansion and Pharmacy Access"

> <details><summary>Abstract</summary> This paper examines the impact of the expansion of chain pharmacies on consumer welfare. Anecdotal evidence presents mixed predictions. It suggests that the elderly population might be the most affected, potentially losing consumer welfare due to difficulties in accessing more distant pharmacies because of higher transportation costs. Conversely, consumers could benefit from competitive pricing and higher-quality services offered by chain pharmacies. Preliminary results suggest that the impact of chain pharmacies' expansion on pricing, along with an expanded choice set, could benefit the majority of consumers, especially those with minimal mobility costs. Full structural models could propose and compare various government interventions. These policies include physician bonus programs, pharmacy student loan programs in rural areas, and subsidies for entry costs. Since structural analysis does not require post-policy analysis, the welfare assessment will inform policymakers about the most cost-effective policies to improve access to prescriptions at low costs.

- "Machine Learning for Dynamic Games" (with [Arie Beresteanu](https://sites.pitt.edu/~arie/))

> <details><summary>Abstract</summary> This paper develops estimation and inference methods for dynamic games with high-dimensional controls. Building on the work of Kim (2023), the methods integrate the double/debiased machine learning (DML) approach with the dynamic discrete games model of BBL (2007). We provide valid inference for low-dimensional parameters of interest, even in the presence of high-dimensional nuisance parameters when implementing machine learning estimators, including Random Forest, Lasso, Elastic Net, and Boosting Methods. The proposed estimator is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal.
