- [Estimating Switching Costs for Telecommunication Services and Bundles*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00036846.2022.2030046) (with [Hyunchul Kim](https://hyunkimecon.github.io/)), Accepted at Applied Economics, [working paper version](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3787321)

> <details><summary>Abstract</summary>  We develop a consumer level demand model of telecommunications and broadcasting services taking into account the exhaustive set of alternatives available to consumers, including bundled services. We then estimate the switching costs associated with bundling. Previous studies are confined to choices of only one or two services, rather than addressing inter-relationships among different services made possible through bundling. We find that our approach improves the accuracy of switching cost estimates compared with when the choice sets are restricted in demand models. Our results also indicate that switching costs incurred with bundling are substantial, making up approximately 65% of monthly service costs. </details>

-  Double/Debiased Machine Learning for Static Games with Incomplete Information [early draft, May 2023 ver](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4377695)

> <details><summary>Abstract</summary>  This paper introduces estimation and inference methods for static games with incomplete information, utilizing modern machine learning techniques. Traditional two-step methods, as discussed in Bajari et al. (2010), are limited to low-dimensional covariates relative to the sample size N. In the case of high-dimensional data, machine learning estimators are commonly employed to recover the first-stage nuisance parameters η, which represent the rival’s action probabilities. However, the use of these prevalent methods can unintentionally introduce biases into the structural parameter of interest, θ0, due to regularization and overfitting challenges. To address these biases, the proposed estimator leverages Neyman orthogonal moments and a cross-fitting algorithm. This allows researchers to utilize machine learning methods such as Lasso, Random Forest, or Neural Networks to estimate the first-stage nuisance parameters. Consequently, the resulting estimates of the structural parameters of interest are √N -consistent and asymptotically normal. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that without correcting the moment condition, the nuisance parameters estimated from machine learning estimators can cause substantial downward biases (towards zero) in the estimates of θ0. In contrast, the proposed estimator based on orthogonal moments effectively mitigates these biases, leading to unbiased estimates centered around the true value.
