- [Estimating Switching Costs for Telecommunication Services and Bundles*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00036846.2022.2030046) (with [Hyunchul Kim](https://hyunkimecon.github.io/)), Accepted at Applied Economics, [working paper version](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3787321)

> <details><summary>Abstract</summary>  We develop a consumer-level demand model of telecommunications and broadcasting services taking into account the exhaustive set of alternatives available to consumers, including bundled services. We then estimate the switching costs associated with bundling. Previous studies are confined to choices of only one or two services, rather than addressing inter-relationships among different services made possible through bundling. We find that our approach improves the accuracy of switching cost estimates compared with when the choice sets are restricted in demand models. Our results also indicate that switching costs incurred with bundling is substantial, making up approximately 65% of monthly service costs. </details>

-  Machine Learning for Static Games with Incomplete Information: An Application to Limited Pharmacy Access (Job Market Paper), [Online Appendix](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mla3xap1u7fb1yj8xodmq/Online_Appendix_HJ_Kim.pdf?rlkey=8vi95zb8zxaplvx2tm89hy2xs&dl=0)

> <details><summary>Abstract</summary>  This paper introduces a new method for the estimation and inference of static discrete game models that include many market characteristics. In estimating strategic interactions,  applied researchers often face the challenge of selecting relevant firm or market characteristics. To address challenges and allow data-driven covariate selection, I incorporate double/debiased machine learning (DML) into static games with incomplete information. The empirical application of this approach focuses on the strategic interactions of pharmacies and their impact on access in rural areas. The decline of independent pharmacies, driven by the proliferation of chain pharmacies, has resulted in reduced pharmacy accessibility in rural areas. I employ the newly developed estimator to recover the parameters of rival effects. I find that the impact of a competing independent pharmacy is 50\% larger using the methods I developed compared to the traditional estimators. This significant difference stems from the fact that ML methods are particularly effective at automatically detecting and incorporating complex, non-linear interactions between covariates, thereby enhancing predictive powers. Counterfactual scenarios provide insights for policy interventions targeted at improving the limited access to pharmacies in rural towns. </details>
