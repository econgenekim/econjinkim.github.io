- [Estimating Switching Costs for Telecommunication Services and Bundles*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00036846.2022.2030046) (with [Hyunchul Kim](https://hyunkimecon.github.io/)), Accepted at Applied Economics, [working paper version](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3787321)

> <details><summary>Abstract</summary>  We develop a consumer-level demand model of telecommunications and broadcasting services taking into account the exhaustive set of alternatives available to consumers, including bundled services. We then estimate the switching costs associated with bundling. Previous studies are confined to choices of only one or two services, rather than addressing inter-relationships among different services made possible through bundling. We find that our approach improves the accuracy of switching cost estimates compared with when the choice sets are restricted in demand models. Our results also indicate that switching costs incurred with bundling is substantial, making up approximately 65% of monthly service costs. </details>

-  Double/Debiased Machine Learning for Static Games with Incomplete Information (new drafts will be updated soon), Conference Presented at NASMES 2023, IAAE 2023, EARIE 2023

> <details><summary>Abstract</summary>  I examine the application of structural game models to the growing body of high-dimensional data to estimate strategic interactions between players. In the case of high-dimensional data relative to sample size $N$, machine learning estimators are commonly employed. However, the use of Machine Learning methods suffers from regularization and over-fitting biases, which unintentionally introduce biases into the structural parameter of interest. Using econometric models, I successfully remove biases induced by Machine Learning so that I provide both estimation and valid inference methods. Applying this model to games between independent pharmacies reveals that the effect of a rival independent pharmacy is 50\% larger using the developed methodologies than classical game models. This difference is primarily due to machine learning's ability to  accommodate flexible functional forms and its higher predictive performance. Counterfactual discusses the policy intervention of improving limited pharmacy access in rural towns. </details>
