- [Estimating Switching Costs for Telecommunication Services and Bundles*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00036846.2022.2030046) (with [Hyunchul Kim](https://hyunkimecon.github.io/)), Accepted at Applied Economics, [working paper version](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3787321)

> <details><summary>Abstract</summary>  We develop a consumer-level demand model of telecommunications and broadcasting services taking into account the exhaustive set of alternatives available to consumers, including bundled services. We then estimate the switching costs associated with bundling. Previous studies are confined to choices of only one or two services, rather than addressing inter-relationships among different services made possible through bundling. We find that our approach improves the accuracy of switching cost estimates compared with when the choice sets are restricted in demand models. Our results also indicate that switching costs incurred with bundling is substantial, making up approximately 65% of monthly service costs. </details>

-  Double/Debiased Machine Learning for Static Games with Incomplete Information (new drafts will be updated soon), Conference Presented at NASMES 2023, IAAE 2023, EARIE 2023

> <details><summary>Abstract</summary>  Although the availability of high-dimensional data sets is increasing, structural game models have difficulty incorporating them. In this paper, I integrate double/debiased machine learning into static games with incomplete information. I provide both estimation and inference methods for these models and show how the popular estimation method of Bajari et al. (2010b) can be adapted to accommodate the presence of high-dimensional nuisance parameters. For an empirical application of the tools I develop, I study the important issue of rural pharmacy access. I document that the decline of independent pharmacies is associated with the entry of chains, leading to more limited pharmacy access in rural towns. This is because independent pharmacies are more likely to be located in rural towns, whereas chain pharmacies prefer locations with higher demand (e.g., urban areas and shopping malls) - typically farther from rural towns. To capture strategic interactions, I model independent pharmacy entry and exit as a static game of incomplete information. This paper finds that the effect of a rival independent pharmacy is 50% larger using the developed methodologies than using the method of Bajari et al. (2010b). This difference is primarily due to machine learning’s ability to accommodate flexible functional forms and its higher predictive performance. The paper’s first counterfactual simulation finds that new chain pharmacy entries can explain 40% of the closures among independent pharmacies from 2000 to 2019. The second counterfactual evaluates the effect of a subsidy program on improving limited pharmacy access, similar to the physician bonus program for Medicare-related services that targets areas with limited medical access. The analysis shows that 16% of rural towns previously identified as having restricted pharmacy access would no longer be categorized as such. </details>
