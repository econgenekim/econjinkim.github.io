- [Estimating Switching Costs for Telecommunication Services and Bundles*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00036846.2022.2030046) (with [Hyunchul Kim](https://hyunkimecon.github.io/)), Accepted at Applied Economics, [working paper version](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3787321)

> <details><summary>Abstract</summary>  We develop a consumer-level demand model of telecommunications and broadcasting services taking into account the exhaustive set of alternatives available to consumers, including bundled services. We then estimate the switching costs associated with bundling. Previous studies are confined to choices of only one or two services, rather than addressing inter-relationships among different services made possible through bundling. We find that our approach improves the accuracy of switching cost estimates compared with when the choice sets are restricted in demand models. Our results also indicate that switching costs incurred with bundling is substantial, making up approximately 65% of monthly service costs. </details>

-  Double/Debiased Machine Learning for Static Games with Incomplete Information (new drafts will be updated soon), Conference Presented at NASMES 2023, IAAE 2023, EARIE 2023

> <details><summary>Abstract</summary>  This paper develops estimation and inference methods for game-theoretic models with many covariates. The methods combine the double/debiased machine learning (DML) framework with static games with incomplete information structure as in Bajariet al. (2010b). I provide valid inferences for low-dimensional parameters of interest in the presence of high-dimensional nuisance parameters when using machine learning estimators. An empirical application studies the growing issue of limited pharmacy access in rural Midwestern United States. The paper finds that the decline of independent pharmacies is associated with the new entry of chain pharmacies which leads to more limited pharmacy access. The effects are more pronounced in elderly towns. Using the static games of independent pharmacies, this paper finds that the effect of the rival independent pharmacy is 1.5 times larger using the developed estimator compared to Bajari et al. (2010b)â€™s estimator. I further find that the predictive performance of machine learning methods plays an important role in this difference. The first counterfactual simulation studies the role of new chain pharmacies in the local market structure. In the second counterfactual experiment, this paper evaluates the effect of the proposed subsidy program on improving limited pharmacy access, similar to the physician bonus program for Medicare-related services targeting areas with limited medical access. </details>
