- [Estimating Switching Costs for Telecommunication Services and Bundles*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00036846.2022.2030046) (with [Hyunchul Kim](https://hyunkimecon.github.io/)), Applied Economics 54(37) (2022): 4356-4373., [working paper version](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3787321)

> <details><summary>Abstract</summary>  We develop a consumer-level demand model of telecommunications and broadcasting services taking into account the exhaustive set of alternatives available to consumers, including bundled services. We then estimate the switching costs associated with bundling. Previous studies are confined to choices of only one or two services, rather than addressing inter-relationships among different services made possible through bundling. We find that our approach improves the accuracy of switching cost estimates compared with when the choice sets are restricted in demand models. Our results also indicate that switching costs incurred with bundling are substantial, making up approximately 65% of monthly service costs. </details>

-  [Rural Pharmacy Access and Competition: Static Games with Machine Learning (Job Market Paper)](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/87rbv5kq5t2sxymz6acva/JMP_HJ_Kim.pdf?rlkey=fhs1hggnb6vmu2u9ncymn67u6&dl=0), [Online Appendix](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mla3xap1u7fb1yj8xodmq/Online_Appendix_HJ_Kim.pdf?rlkey=8vi95zb8zxaplvx2tm89hy2xs&dl=0)

> <details><summary>Abstract</summary> This paper provides the first empirical evidence for the impact of the entry of chain pharmacies on competition,  market structure, and pharmacy access in rural towns. Using a detailed panel dataset spanning 2000-2019 in the Midwestern United States, I document that the entries of new chain pharmacies in urban towns have led to a large decline in the number of independent pharmacies from nearby rural towns. These industry shifts contribute to a decrease in pharmacy access in rural towns, especially in towns where over 20 percent of the population is aged 65 or older. To decompose the competition effects from chain pharmacies and rival independent pharmacies, I utilize existing static game models. To allow for a data-driven selection of many market characteristics in pharmacy profits, I incorporate double/debiased machine learning (DML) into the estimation of static games and provide valid inferences.  By leveraging the predictive performance of machine learning estimators, I find that the impact of a rival independent pharmacy on profit is 50 percent greater than that implied by existing models. In rural towns with a high elderly population ratio, the estimated model shows that chain pharmacy entries could explain 40 percent of the closures of independent pharmacies between 2000 and 2019. A subsidy policy counterfactual simulation shows that 16 percent of rural towns previously identified as having limited pharmacy access would no longer be categorized as such.

- [Horizontal Merger and Post-Entry Market Structure: Evidence from Acquisition in the Retail Pharmacy Market](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/dg5sh8mn1cdzk8zk9bycz/Horizontal_Merger_and_Post_Entries.pdf?rlkey=xl1llhu4b818os6b1vje91mt5&dl=0) 
> <details><summary>Abstract</summary>  This paper provides the first causal estimates of the effects of horizontal mergers on post-entry behaviors. I examine whether horizontal mergers of dominant firms reduce competition and facilitate market entry for new entrants. The horizontal merger guidelines, issued by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, state that regulatory agencies should evaluate whether post-merger entry would be timely, likely, and sufficient to counteract any adverse effects on competition. I evaluate post-merger entry behavior by examining the controversial horizontal merger between Walgreens and Rite Aid in 2018, where Walgreens and Rite Aid respectively held the first and third ranks in market shares. This merger raised public and antitrust concerns, as mergers between dominant firms can decrease competition and reduce consumer welfare. Using a staggered difference-in-differences estimation approach, I find that horizontal mergers are associated with a 0.6-unit (27\%) decrease in the total number of stores, which could decrease the competition. Furthermore, no causal evidence was found that horizontal mergers lead to new market entries by non-merging competitors. These findings challenge the assertion by merging firms that any reduction in competition from a merger would be offset by new entries. For antitrust policy, these results suggest that policymakers might need to scrutinize proposed horizontal mergers more rigorously, considering potential market entry to adequately address antitrust concerns. </details>
