- [Estimating Switching Costs for Telecommunication Services and Bundles*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00036846.2022.2030046) (with [Hyunchul Kim](https://hyunkimecon.github.io/)), Accepted at Applied Economics, [working paper version](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3787321)

> <details><summary>Abstract</summary>  We develop a consumer-level demand model of telecommunications and broadcasting services taking into account the exhaustive set of alternatives available to consumers, including bundled services. We then estimate the switching costs associated with bundling. Previous studies are confined to choices of only one or two services, rather than addressing inter-relationships among different services made possible through bundling. We find that our approach improves the accuracy of switching cost estimates compared with when the choice sets are restricted in demand models. Our results also indicate that switching costs incurred with bundling is substantial, making up approximately 65% of monthly service costs. </details>

-  [Machine Learning for Static Games with Incomplete Information: An Application to Rural Pharmacy Access (Job Market Paper)](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/87rbv5kq5t2sxymz6acva/JMP_HJ_Kim.pdf?rlkey=fhs1hggnb6vmu2u9ncymn67u6&dl=0), [Online Appendix](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mla3xap1u7fb1yj8xodmq/Online_Appendix_HJ_Kim.pdf?rlkey=8vi95zb8zxaplvx2tm89hy2xs&dl=0)

 [Abstract]: This paper proposes a new method for the estimation and inference of static discrete game models with many market characteristics. To allow for a data-driven selection of characteristics, I incorporate double/debiased machine learning (DML) into the estimation of static games within complete information. 

I apply my developed methodology to study the strategic entry decisions of independent pharmacies in rural regions of the Midwestern United States. This application is well-suited because the market characteristics and their functional forms that influence pharmacy openings are often unknown to researchers. I provide the first empirical findings: 1) the exit of independent pharmacies from rural towns is associated with the entry of new chain pharmacies in urbanized areas; 2) the industry shifts contribute to increasingly limited pharmacy access in rural towns; and 3) these trends are more pronounced in towns with a high elderly population. My structural estimation shows that the impact of a competing independent pharmacy on prof-its is 50% larger, compared to the existing estimators. This substantial difference arises from the machine learning methods’ ability to detect and utilize complex non-linear relationships, thereby enhancing the predictive power of the rival’s entry choice probabilities. In rural towns with a high elderly population, the estimated model suggests that chain pharmacy entries could account for 40% of the closures of independent pharmacies between 2000 and 2019. The policy counterfactual reveals that 16% of rural towns previously identified as having limited pharmacy access would no longer be categorized as such.

- [Horizontal Merger and Post-Entry Market Structure: Evidence from Acquisition in the Retail Pharmacy Market](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/dg5sh8mn1cdzk8zk9bycz/Horizontal_Merger_and_Post_Entries.pdf?rlkey=xl1llhu4b818os6b1vje91mt5&dl=0) 
> <details><summary>Abstract</summary>  This paper provides the first causal estimates of the effects of horizontal mergers on post-entry behaviors. I study whether horizontal mergers of dominant firms reduce competition and facilitate market entry for new entrants, potentially mitigating any significant decrease in competition. The horizontal merger guidelines, issued by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, state that regulatory agencies should evaluate whether post-merger entry would be timely, likely, and sufficient to counteract any adverse effects on competition. I evaluate post-merger entry behavior by examining the controversial horizontal merger between Walgreens and Rite Aid in 2018. Walgreens and Rite Aid held the first and third ranks in market shares, respectively. This merger raised public and antitrust concerns, as mergers between dominant firms can impair competition and reduce consumer welfare. Using a staggered difference-in-differences estimation approach, I find that horizontal mergers are associated with a 0.6-unit (17%) decrease in the total number of stores, which could decrease the competition. Furthermore, I find no causal evidence that horizontal mergers lead to new market entries by non-merging competitors. These findings challenge the assertion by merging firms that any reduction in competition from a merger would be offset by new entries. For antitrust policy, these results suggest that policymakers might need to scrutinize proposed horizontal mergers more rigorously, taking potential market entry into consideration to adequately address antitrust concerns. </details>
