I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Economics at University of Pittsburgh.

My primary research areas are Empirical Industrial Organization, Applied Econometrics, and Applied Microeocnomics. I am particularly interested in combining Machine Learning tools with Structural Econometrics (IO applications).
