My name is Hyungjin (Hyung-Jin) Kim, but everyone simply calls me Jin. I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Pittsburgh. 

My research interests include Industrial Organization and Applied Econometrics. Specifically, I am interested in integrating Machine Learning techniques with Structural Econometrics, particularly in the context of Industrial Organization applications.
