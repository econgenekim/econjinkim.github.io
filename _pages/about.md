My name is Hyungjin (Hyung-Jin) Kim, but everyone simply calls me Jin. 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Pittsburgh. I am on the job market this 2023-24 academic year and will be available for interviews.

I am interested in exploring questions at the intersection of Industrial Organization, Health Economics, and Machine Learning. Currently, my research focuses on (1) understanding the role of firms' behaviors in shaping economic and health outcomes, (2) studying anti-trust policy and issues, and (3) developing econometrics tools to better understand these research topics.


Research Interests:

 <strong>Primary Field</strong>: Empirical Industrial Organization, Health Economics, and Machine Learning

 <strong>Secondary Field</strong>: Applied Microeconomics, Applied Econometrics
